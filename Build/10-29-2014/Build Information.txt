Controls:

-Left click to place tower
-Right click to deselect it
-Middle button to delete it, tower has to be selected

Additional Info:
-If you click an existing tower, it will select it and you can move it. 

-In the top left, the text going from top to bottom is: Spawn time, cycle counter, FPS, and kill count.
	Spawn Time is just the counter used for spawning enemies.
	Cycle counter is used to count the number of enemies spawned, changes occasionally
	FPS is the frames counted per second
	Kill count is how many enemies were killed

-Enemy health starts at 100, increases by 10 every time it's spawned

-At the top left, to the right of the info text, is an enemy object and a blue square. Clicking on the enemy object will enable you to spawn enemies all over the board, just click and drag. Clicking the blue square will change the spawn object back to a tower, so you can place towers again. 

Known Issues:

-Muzzle Flash sticks sometimes, will show even when not firing
-Texture for enemy has a line at the bottom
-When spawning enemies through the mouse click, if you're dragging a tower it will spawn enemies at the tower's position
-While dragging a tower, if you go over another tower, it will drop the tower you were dragging and pick up the new tower instead
-With 40 or more towers, frame rate drops considerably low, often around 10fps depending on your system
